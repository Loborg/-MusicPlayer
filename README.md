This is the fourth project for Udacity’s Android Basic Nanodegree Scholarship. 
The app represents a Music Structure application.
The app can’t play music, as it is.
The app is for education reasons only, all image material is from Discogs website
Known issues:
-	When the home button is pressed in the TrackActivity it resets the HomeActivity’s footer play button even it was set to show the pause button.
-	There is no Album button on the TrackActivity because the given time, I can’t finish the proper behaviour of the intended button. The AlbumActivity is still reachable from the HomeActivity by pressing the album’s title.

Here are some screenshots from the app:
